# Infrastructure variant packages

This repository contains package configuration information and automation for the ROS Infrastructure variant packages.

Currently there are two variants used for ROS Infrastructure.

[`ros-build-essential`](./ros-build-essential) contains the base set of packages to be present when building any ROS package on the build farm.

[`ros-dev-tools`](./ros-dev-tools) contains packages that are of general use to ROS developers but which are not dependencies of any particular packages within a ROS distribution.

These packages are published to the following distributions via the ROS bootstrap repositories:

* Debian: bullseye
* Ubuntu: focal, jammy
* RHEL: 8
